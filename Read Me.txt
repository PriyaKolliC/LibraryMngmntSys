getch() in the program code works fine with versions till 12.11
In case if you find any problem with getch() with the error "Drawing operation was attempted before window load" 
then change getch() to getchar() and update ascii values of characters to actual escape sequences.
For Ex:
Change-
getch()
if(ch==13)
To-
getchar()
if(ch=='\n')
where 13 is Ascii value of enter key.
